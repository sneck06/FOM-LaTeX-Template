\section{Domain-Specific Languages}
Commonly known programming languages, such as C or Java, are also called a \ac{GPL}. \ac{GPL}s are designed to handle any problem with relatively equal levels of efficiency and expressiveness. However, many applications do not require a multifunctional \ac{GPL} and can describe a problem more naturally using a \ac{DSL}. \ac{DSL}s are languages that have been developed specifically for a particular application or domain, to be able to develop faster and more effectively. \parencite[cf.][p. 1]{hudak_domain-specific_1997}
By tailoring notations and constructs to the domain in question, \ac{DSL}s offer significant gains in expressiveness and usability compared to \ac{GPL}s for the domain in question, with corresponding productivity gains and lower maintenance costs. \parencite[cf.][p. 317]{mernik_when_2005}
\ac{DSL}s are by no means a product of modern software development but have existed since the beginning of programming. One of the first \ac{DSL}s ever designed was \ac{APT}, which was used for the development of numerically controlled machine tools in 1957. \parencite[cf.][pp. 283-284]{wexelblat_origins_1978}\\
\ac{DSL}s can be found everywhere in the world of IT, for example, this thesis was written with the help of \LaTeX{} to design layout and formatting. Table \ref{tbl:popular_dsl} lists some well-known \ac{DSL}s and their application/domain to give examples of what is classified as a \ac{DSL}.

Programs written in a \ac{DSL} are considered to be more concise, quicker to write, easier to maintain and easier to reason about and most importantly they can be written by non-programmers. In particular, experts in the domain for which the \ac{DSL} was developed can use \ac{DSL}s to program applications without having to acquire programming skills. An expert of a domain already knows the semantics of the domain, all that is needed to start development is the corresponding notation that expresses these semantics. \parencite[cf.][pp. 2-4]{hudak_domain-specific_1997}
