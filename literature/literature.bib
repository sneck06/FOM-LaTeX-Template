	abstract = {Distributed systems have become more fine-grained as organizations shift from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of problems. With lots of examples and practical advice, this expanded second edition takes a holistic view of the topics system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservices architectures. Author Sam Newman provides you with a firm grounding in the concepts while diving into the latest solutions for modeling, integrating, testing, deploying, and monitoring your own autonomous services. Through real-world examples, you'll learn how organizations worldwide are getting the most out of these architectures. Microservices technologies are moving quickly. This book brings you up to speed. Get new information on user interfaces, container orchestration, and serverless Use microservices to align system design with your organization's goals Explore options for integrating a service with the rest of your system Take an incremental approach when splitting monolithic codebases Deploy individual microservices through continuous integration Examine the complexities of testing and monitoring distributed services Manage security with expanded content around user-to-service and service-to-service models Understand the challenges of scaling microservices architectures.},

	abstract = {The MonALISA (Monitoring Agents in A Large Integrated Services Architecture) system provides a distributed monitoring service. MonALISA is based on a scalable Dynamic Distributed Services Architecture which is designed to meet the needs of physics collaborations for monitoring global Grid systems, and is implemented using JINI/JAVA and WSDL/SOAP technologies. The scalability of the system derives from the use of multithreaded Station Servers to host a variety of loosely coupled self-describing dynamic services, the ability of each service to register itself and then to be discovered and used by any other services, or clients that require such information, and the ability of all services and clients subscribing to a set of events (state changes) in the system to be notified automatically. The framework integrates several existing monitoring tools and procedures to collect parameters describing computational nodes, applications and network performance. It has built-in SNMP support and network-performance monitoring algorithms that enable it to monitor end-to-end network performance as well as the performance and state of site facilities in a Grid. MonALISA is currently running around the clock on the US CMS test Grid as well as an increasing number of other sites. It is also being used to monitor the performance and optimize the interconnections among the reflectors in the VRVS system.},

The planning and design of the whole scheme start from the analysis of the microservice architecture, through the analysis and comparison of the microservice system monitoring system and various microservice application system monitoring schemes, and further combining the push-pull mode selection of the monitoring system with the analysis of the intelligent alarm scheme.The improvement of the monitoring mode of the microservice application system from the local triggering alarm to the intelligent alarm is finally realized. Experimental results present the plan can more systematically consider the data of all monitoring levels, then analyze and summarize, and finally achieve more timely, more accurately and more effectively monitoring and earlier warning of the microservice application system.},

	abstract = {Automated tools for understanding application behavior and its changes during the application lifecycle are essential for many performance analysis and debugging tasks. Application performance issues have an immediate impact on customer experience and satisfaction. A sudden slowdown of enterprise-wide application can effect a large population of customers, lead to delayed projects, and ultimately can result in company financial loss. Significantly shortened time between new software releases further exacerbates the problem of thoroughly evaluating the performance of an updated application. Our thesis is that online performance modeling should be a part of routine application monitoring. Early, informative warnings on significant changes in application performance should help service providers to timely identify and prevent performance problems and their negative impact on the service. We propose a novel framework for automated anomaly detection and application change analysis. It is based on integration of two complementary techniques: (i) a regression-based transaction model that reflects a resource consumption model of the application, and (ii) an application performance signature that provides a compact model of runtime behavior of the application. The proposed integrated framework provides a simple and powerful solution for anomaly detection and analysis of essential performance changes in application behavior. An additional benefit of the proposed approach is its simplicity: It is not intrusive and is based on monitoring data that is typically available in enterprise production environments. The introduced solution further enables the automation of capacity planning and resource provisioning tasks of multitier applications in rapidly evolving IT environments.},

Several IS researchers have pioneered the acceptance of DS research in IS, but in the last 15 years little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a generally accepted process for DS research in IS may have contributed to this problem. We sought to design a design science research process (DSRP) model that would meet three objectives: it would be consistent with prior literature, it would provide a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it would provide a mental model for presenting and appreciating DS research in IS. The process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, objectives for a solution, design and development, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrated the process by using it in this study and by presenting two case studies, one in IS planning to develop application ideas for mobile financial services and another in requirements engineering to specify feature requirements for a self service advertising design and sales system intended for wide audience end users. The process effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

The evaluation is very often done linguistically. Several scales have been proposed to translate the linguistic evaluation into a quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we perform an experiment to investigate, under our methodological choices, which type of scale provides the best matching of the decision-maker’s verbal representation. The experiment aims to evaluate the suitability of eight evaluation scales for problems of different sizes. We ﬁnd that the inverse linear scale provides the best matching verbal representation whenever the objective data are measured by means of pairwise comparisons matrices and a suitable distance between matrices is applied for computing the matching error.},

	abstract = {Seminal works in the application of design science research (DSR) in IS emphasize the importance of evaluation. However, discussion of evaluation activities and methods is limited and typically assumes an ex post perspective, in which evaluation occurs after the construction of an IS artifact. Such perspectives can assume that the evaluation is an empirical process and its methods can be selected in the same way as empirical research methods. In this paper, we analyze a broader range of evaluation strategies, which includes ex ante (prior to artifact construction) evaluation. This broader view is developed as a strategic DSR evaluation framework, which expands evaluation choices for IS DSR researchers, and also adds emphasis to strategies for evaluating design processes in addition to design products, using well-known quality criteria as an important asset. The framework encompasses both ex ante and ex post orientations as well as naturalistic settings (e.g., case studies) and artificial settings (e.g., lab experiments) for DSR evaluation. The framework proposed offers a strategic view of DSR evaluation that is useful in analyzing published studies, and also in surfacing the evaluation opportunities that present themselves to IS DSR researchers.},

	abstract = {A common topic when performing research in technical disciplines is to design some kind of artefact, such as a model, an information system, or a method for performing a certain task. To address this topic in a systematic and scientific way, Design Science Research (DSR) has established itself as an appropriate research method. There are many different variations of DSR, on different levels of complexity and detail, but all are based on an iterative approach of designing the desired artefact and evaluating it. This makes it difficult for many students to get an understanding of DSR in order to use it for their thesis (on bachelor or master level). The goal of the current paper therefore is to provide a short introduction to DSR for these students, based on the DSR variant described by (Österle et al., 2010) which is considered fairly basic and easy to understand and use. We do not try to introduce any new approach to DSR but provide a short introduction to this existing variant of DSR.},

Recently, microservices are often mentioned in one breath with container technologies like Docker. That is why operating system virtualization experiences a renaissance in cloud computing. These approaches shall provide horizontally scalable, easily deployable systems and a high-performance alternative to hypervisors. Nevertheless, performance impacts of containers on top of hypervisors are hardly investigated. Furthermore, microservice frameworks often come along with software deﬁned networks. This contribution presents benchmark results to quantify the impacts of container, software deﬁned networking and encryption on network performance. Even containers, although postulated to be lightweight, show a noteworthy impact to network performance. These impacts can be minimized on several system layers. Some design recommendations for cloud deployed systems following the microservice architecture pattern are derived.},

The shortest iteration consists in applying the toolkit to the software portfolio to obtain and register basic facts such as metrics and dependencies. In the middle iteration, the engineers interpret and evaluate the newly registered facts. The ﬁndings are reported to IT management together with recommendations about how to react to the ﬁndings. In particular, one kind of recommendation is to carry out a Software Risk Assessment on a selected system or project.

	abstract = {Microservice architecture allows different parts of an application to be developed, deployed and scaled independently, therefore becoming a trend for developing cloud applications. However, it comes with challenging security issues. First, the network complexity introduced by the large number of microservices greatly increases the difﬁculty in monitoring the security of the entire application. Second, microservices are often designed to completely trust each other, therefore compromise of a single microservice may bring down the entire application. The problems are only exacerbated by the cloud, since applications no longer have complete control over their networks. In this paper, we propose a design for security-as-aservice for microservices-based cloud applications. By adding a new API primitive FlowTap for the network hypervisor, we build a ﬂexible monitoring and policy enforcement infrastructure for network trafﬁc to secure cloud applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by deploying the Bro network monitor using FlowTap. Results show that our solution is ﬂexible enough to support various kinds of monitoring scenarios and policies and it incurs minimal overhead (∼6\%) for real world usage. As a result, cloud applications can leverage our solution to deploy network security monitors to ﬂexibly detect and block threats both external and internal to their network.},

In this study, we used Acme Air, an open-source benchmark application for Web services, and analyzed the behavior of the application in two models, microservice and monolithic, for two widely used language runtimes, Node.js and Java Enterprise Edition (EE). We observed a significant overhead due to the microservice architecture; the performance of the microservice model can be 79.1\% lower than the monolithic model on the same hardware configuration. The microservice model spent much more time in runtime libraries to process one client request than the monolithic model by 4.22x on a Node.js application server and by 2.69x on a Java EE application server. We explain the performance impact due to the microservice architecture through detailed performance analysis. We also discuss the performance impact due to network virtualization associated with the Docker container framework, which is commonly used as an infrastructure for microservices. These findings give us clues to optimizing the language runtime and hardware architecture for microservices.},

	abstract = {Contemporary highly dynamic technology and business environments, coupled with digitally savvy customers, are forcing both private and public organizations to continuously innovate and update their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) service offerings. In order to decrease the development cycles and ensure continuous delivery, many organizations are adopting new practices aimed at unifying software development and operations (i.e., DevOps). However, monolithic architectures of many large systems underpinning ICT services are severely restricting the effectiveness of such efforts. Although the latest architectural trend, microservices, is promising to solve many of the problems associated with monolithic software architectures, there is significant disagreement on when microservice architecture should be adopted, as well as how it may be best implemented. Given the limited empirical research on the topic, this paper identifies and discusses a range of opportunities and challenges associated with the adoption and implementation of microservices. The findings presented in the paper have been derived from in-depth interviews with 19 ICT architects with significant experience in large corporate systems, middleware, service oriented architectures, and, to a somewhat more limited extent, microservices.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the problem of ranking a collection of objects using pairwise comparisons (rankings of two objects). In general, the ranking of n objects can be identiﬁed by standard sorting methods using n log2 n pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a d-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reﬂect their relative distances from a common reference point in Rd. We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like n2d and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than d log n adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis.},

These changes are tackled by the approach of modular process plants. Modular process plants promise a shorter time-to-market and a high flexibility regarding the products produced herein. To achieve these advantages, beside the mechanical modularization also the control systems of such plants need to change. Current process control systems are not able to fulfill all requirements of modularization. Therefore, known approaches from information technology are adapted for the automation of modular process plants. Beside service-oriented architectures, the Microservice approach is of current interest in the information technology domain. This approach is presented in this contribution, and the suitability of Microservices as an architecture for modular process automation is analyzed.

	abstract = {Context. Since its proclamation in 2012, microservices-based architecture has gained widespread popularity due to its advantages, such as improved availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability, as well as greater software development agility. Motivation. Yet, refactoring a monolith to microservices by smaller businesses and expecting that the migration will bring beneﬁts similar to those reported by top global companies, such as Netﬂix, Amazon, eBay, and Uber, might be an illusion. Indeed, for systems that do not have thousands of concurrent users and can be scaled vertically, the beneﬁts of such migration have not been sufﬁciently investigated, while the existing evidence is inconsistent. Objective. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance and scalability of monolithic and microservice architectures on a reference web application. Method. The application was implemented in four different versions, covering not only two different architectural styles (monolith vs. microservices) but also two different implementation technologies (Java vs. C\# .NET). Next, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in three different deployment environments (local, Azure Spring Cloud, and Azure App Service). Findings. The key lessons learned are as follows: (1) on a single machine, a monolith performs better than its microservice-based counterpart; (2) The Java platform makes better use of powerful machines in case of computation-intensive services when compared to .NET; the technology platform effect is reversed when non-computationally intensive services are run on machines with low computational capacity; (3) vertical scaling is more cost-effective than horizontal scaling in the Azure cloud; (4) scaling out beyond a certain number of instances degrades the application performance; (5) implementation technology (either Java or C\# .NET) does not have a noticeable impact on the scalability performance.},

We demonstrate that through simple afﬁnitization of kernel threads to cores of a Non-Uniform Memory Access processor and disk buffer conﬁgurations, there is a 26\% and 19\% decrease in Average Latency accompanied by a 27\% decrease in 99\% Tail latency for the benchmarks under consideration. While performance improvements can be gained, we also show that alternate nonoptimal conﬁgurations of the system parameters degrade the performance substantially.},

This paper proposes an enterprise architecture methodological framework to design the so-called microservice architecture known as MSA. Our approach is to describe the similarities between the MSA style of architecture and the service-oriented architecture known as SOA, the latter having a rich research literature focused on exploiting the methodology for designing services in a service architecture. The result of the comparative study indicates that the ideology for designing a SOA is identical as MSA which ultimately relies on decomposing applications into smaller components with a smaller and more manageable footprint. Thus, we conclude that it is preferable to use the adapted enterprise architecture methodology for SOA to design MSA.},
